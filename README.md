# WeatherApp


You are going to meet an app that shows today's and next 5 days' weather forecast with 3 hours interval.
In this project you will see:
Coordinator Pattern;
Pods(Alamofire, Swinject, PromiseKit, PromiseKit/CoreLocation, SwiftLint);
Location Services;
Openweathermap.

App supports dark and light modes, as well as Portrait and Landscape orientation.

p.s if you are willing to see how the app works abroad( outside of Georgia) uncomment the code on the 37 line in 'Presentation->Today Weather->ViewModels'.


Hope you enjoy :))
