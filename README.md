# WeatherApp


You are going to meet an app that shows today's and next 5 days' weather forecast with 3 hours interval.
In this project you will see:
Coordinator Pattern;
Pods(Alamofire, Swinject, PromiseKit, PromiseKit/CoreLocation, SwiftLint);
Location Services;
Openweathermap.

App supports dark and light modes, as well as Portrait and Landscape orientation.

Hope you enjoy :))
